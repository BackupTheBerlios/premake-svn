When a package links to a sibling package, the sibling's target is added to the list
of libraries to link. However, only the target name is added, not the path. This 
usually works because the targets are all put in the same place. If I link to a lib
that is kept in the package area (package.target = package.path.."/bin") I don't
think linking will work.

Test that paths in GNU LDDEPS variable are set properly when the package is in a
subdirectory under the project.

Add package.linkflags back and wrap under prj_has_flag(), but don't document?
