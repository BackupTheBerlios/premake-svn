If I set package.path to "../../ode", matchfiles() looks in the directory where
premake.lua lives, but files listed in the script are relative to ../../ode. 
Since includepaths, etc. are relative to the final package path, matchfiles()
should probably do the same.


Can identify other windows compilers with __CYGWIN32__ and __MINGW32__

Reimplement packaging scripts for all projects using Premake. Add a new 'build' 
action that will launch the toolset to complete the build. So I can do something
like:

  dobuild("vs2003", "Release")

When a package links to a sibling package, the sibling's target is added to the list
of libraries to link. However, only the target name is added, not the path. This 
usually works because the targets are all put in the same place. If I link to a lib
that is kept in the package area (package.target = package.path.."/bin") I don't
think linking will work.

Test that paths in GNU LDDEPS variable are set properly when the package is in a
subdirectory under the project.
