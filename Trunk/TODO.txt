* `make clean` needs to remove objects for all configs, not just
  the default one ($OBJDIR is set to obj/Debug, instead of obj)

* Document config.targetextension (chage to customtarget or something)

* Docs: no-symbols (not with-symbols)

* Docs: pkg.buildflags inserts, pkg.cfg.buildflags replaces, potential confusion

* Omit frame ptrs from release build

* Phase out linkflags (documentation only, can leave in scripts)

* unicode, no-64bit-checks currently only supported in VS200x generators

* Add support for Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/)
