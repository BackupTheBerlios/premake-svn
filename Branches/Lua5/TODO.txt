When a package links to a sibling package, the sibling's target is added to the list
of libraries to link. However, only the target name is added, not the path. This 
usually works because the targets are all put in the same place. If I link to a lib
that is kept in the package area (package.target = package.path.."/bin") I don't
think linking will work.

Test that paths in GNU LDDEPS variable are set properly when the package is in a
subdirectory under the project.

dopackage() should chdir() to the script directory so relative paths (like to a 
library file as in wx.NET) will work. This will likely screw up my relative pathing
back to the project, but ought to be able to fix by setting project.path to the
full absolute path to the project, rather than just "."
